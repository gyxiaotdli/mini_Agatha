This script is a python version of our original orbital Rcode named Agatha. It can be used to constrain the orbit of long-period companions (e.g., giant planets, brown dwarfs and stellar-mass objects) using the joint analysis of the radial velocity, Hipparcos and Gaia DR2/DR3 absolute astrometry. 

Since our method is independent from the calibration of Hipparcos and Gaia astrometry, it can theoretically be applied to extensive Gaia sources whose hipparcos measurements are not available, particularly for direct imaging systems without accessible RVs. 

More details of our method can be found in Feng et al.2023 (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.525..607F/abstract). 

The current version is still being optimized to improve fitting efficiency.

Please contact us if you have any questions about the use of the code. (Fabo, Feng: fengfabo@gmail.com; Guang-Yao, Xiao: gyxiao_tdli@sjtu.edu.cn)
